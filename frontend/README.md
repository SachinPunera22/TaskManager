# Task Manager Angular App Setup

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (Recommended: Latest LTS version)
- Angular CLI (Install globally if not already installed: `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**
   ```sh

   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/` by default.

## Environment Setup
